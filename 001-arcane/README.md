  As a result, tons of useful insights are never surfaced, which leads to poor decisions and predicitons + bad performance. 
  Sensitive data = untapped potential. 

Solution:

Goal: Unlock analytics capabilties to the owners on sensitive data via homomorphic encryption. 
  With homomorphic encryption, formerly [unfit] data can now be use in machine learning to surface insights. 
  Deliver [analytics capabilities such as machine learning models or visualizations to companies with sensitive data without revealing the underlying data].
  Cryptography replaces trust.
