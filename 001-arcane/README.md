50c: Analytics tool for companies with super sensitive data. (48)

Time Elapsed: â‰ˆ02:10:00

Problem: No [easy] way exists for governments to analyze sensitive data. 
  As a result, tons of useful insights are never surfaced, which leads to poor decisions and predicitons + bad performance. 
  Sensitive data = untapped potential. 

Solution: [Interface between classified government data and their desired machine learning models.]
  A broker/intermediary that securely connects [a party with data that they wish to remain private] to [a party that has something special they can do with that data.]

Goal: Unlock analytics capabilties to the owners on sensitive data via homomorphic encryption. 
  [Encrypt sensitive data before feeding it to private company tools or open source machine learning models.]
  With homomorphic encryption, formerly [unfit] data can now be use in machine learning to surface insights. 
  Deliver [analytics capabilities such as machine learning models or visualizations to companies with sensitive data without revealing the underlying data.]
  Cryptography replaces trust.
  Enable institutions to port their datasets into the best private and open-source models without incurring significant security risks.
